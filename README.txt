Battleship is an old Java project that I found the other day.

The project was going to be a recreation of the Battlefield board game. I implemented all the functionality of the boats, but did not complete the GUI. Every ship is able to be placed, be hit, and sink when appropriate.

It may be finished at some point, but right now I have no plans to.
